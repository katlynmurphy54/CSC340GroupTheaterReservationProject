# Theater Reservation - Group Project - Fall 2020

Problem Statement:
The Lexington Theatre is experiencing a large amount of reservations over the phone recently and now needs an online system to help with the amount of reservations they are receiving.

Proposal:
We propose a user-friendly software system to allow customers to make a reservation, cancel a reservation, register as a new member, change personal information, and check events and their performance days. When making a reservation, the system should allow the customer to choose an event, select seats, make a payment, and get a confirmation number.
System Description:
The online system allows members and non-members to make reservations online. The reservations shall be kept in a database. The customer should also be able to cancel a reservation with the system. The customer should be able to register as a member with the system. This will give them a 10% discount on tickets. The system should allow a customer to change their personal information. The system should also allow a customer to check events and their performance dates.
